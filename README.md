Development sandbox website to showcase the application integration of Rust REST API, Vue 3 Composition API, CSS Modules with vanilla CSS, TypeScript/TSX, Mapbox GL, Deck.GL, PostGIS, Martin MVT Tile Server (written in Rust) and Docker. This implementation features isolated Map instances in separate routes.

In essence, this implementation is a Proof of Concept and MVP Prototype that embodies what I _consider_ to be the major tenets of the three leading JavaScript front-end frameworks, namely:

-   Angular: TypeScript, Dependency Injection and RxJS asynchronous programming

-   React: Functional components, Declarative UI and JSX/TSX

-   Vue 3: Composition API, ES6 Proxy and Pinia

To that end, this custom _hybrid_ front-end framework experiment has been an overwhelming success. Everything coalesces perfectly.

Further, Vite is super fast for HMR development compilation (without Webpack and Babel). Tooling is simplified and cohesive throughout. And the Jest-compatible Vitest unit test framework performs to expectations.

You be the judge...
