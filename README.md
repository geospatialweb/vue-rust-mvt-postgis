# Geospatial Web

https://www.geospatialweb.ca

Development sandbox website to showcase the application integration of Vue 3 Composition API, TypeScript/TSX, CSS Modules with vanilla CSS, Mapbox GL, Deck.GL, Rust REST API, Martin MVT Tile Server (written in Rust), PostGIS and Docker.

This implementation embodies what I _consider_ to be the major tenets of the three leading JavaScript front-end frameworks, namely:

-   Angular: TypeScript, Dependency Injection and RxJS asynchronous programming

-   React: Functional components, Declarative UI and JSX/TSX

-   Vue 3: Composition API, Virtual DOM reactivity and Pinia state management

NOTE: .env file is available upon request at johncampbell@geospatialweb.ca
